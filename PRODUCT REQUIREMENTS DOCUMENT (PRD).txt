PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Product Name

DCA-ControlOS
(A Regulation-First, Contract-Aware AI Operating System for Debt Collection Agencies)

1. Problem Statement

FedEx manages thousands of overdue accounts via external DCAs. Current operations rely on emails, spreadsheets, and manual follow-ups, resulting in delayed recoveries, weak governance, SLA violations, and poor auditability. There is no enforceable, real-time control over DCA actions.

2. Product Vision

Build a digital, AI-powered governance platform that treats DCAs as programmable, regulated operators, enforcing SOPs and SLAs through executable contracts, predictive intelligence, and immutable audit trails.

3. Goals (What success means)

Enforce DCA contracts automatically (not manually)

Predict SLA breaches before they happen

Improve recovery predictability

Create audit-ready, tamper-evident records

Enable scalable, multi-DCA oversight

4. In-Scope (Prototype Scope)

This is a working vertical slice, not full enterprise rollout.

Must-Have (Implemented)

Case ingestion (dummy/synthetic data)

Contract-as-code engine (rules enforced)

AI model:

Recovery probability

SLA breach / compliance risk

Auto-escalation logic

Append-only audit log

Working UI dashboard

Out-of-Scope (Explained, not built)

Payment gateway integration

Real FedEx data

Legal system integrations

Multi-region deployment

5. User Roles

FedEx Admin

Onboards DCAs

Defines contracts & SLAs

Monitors dashboards

DCA Agent

Views assigned cases

Updates status

Auditor (Read-only)

Reviews immutable logs

Checks SLA adherence

6. Functional Requirements
6.1 Case Management

Create / view cases

Attributes:

Amount due

Days overdue

Customer type

Assigned DCA

Status

6.2 Contract-as-Code Engine (Key Differentiator)

Each DCA has a machine-readable contract (JSON/YAML)

Contract defines:

SLA timelines

Required actions

Escalation rules

Penalty flags

Engine validates every case update against rules

6.3 AI / ML Components

Model 1: Recovery Prediction

Inputs: amount, age, customer type

Output: recovery probability

Model 2: Compliance Risk Prediction

Inputs: DCA history, delays, case priority

Output: SLA breach probability

6.4 Automation & Escalation

If SLA at risk → auto-flag

If SLA breached → auto-escalate

High-risk cases reassigned or highlighted

6.5 Audit Trail

Append-only logs

Every action logged with:

Timestamp

Actor

Rule triggered

Before/after state

Hash-chained for tamper evidence

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Role-based access

Explainable AI outputs

Scalable architecture (conceptual)

Secure-by-design (least privilege)

8. KPIs & Impact Metrics

SLA breach rate ↓

Average recovery time ↓

Escalation volume ↓

Audit readiness ↑

Recovery predictability ↑

9. Tech Stack (Prototype)
